Getting Started
---------------
1. Make sure php5-xmlrpc & php5-curl is installed and loaded
    
  `apt-get install php5-xmlrpc php5-curl`

  `service apache2 restart`

2. Include class.bitmessage.php into your PHP script:

	`require_once('class.bitmessage.php');`
    
3. Initialize Bitmessage connection/object:

	`$bitmessageObj = new bitmessage("<RPCusername>:<RPCpassword>@<RPChost>:<RPCport>/");`

    `$bitmessageObj->newAddress($label, $eighteenByteRipe = false, $totalDifficulty = 1, $smallMessageDifficulty = 1);`
    
    `$bitmessageObj->setStrip(true);`
